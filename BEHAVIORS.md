# nixlock — behaviour contract
Review this INSTEAD of the code. Every entry is decidable from outside the process: a situation, an
observable outcome, the failure it prevents, and the boundary next to it.

**Why one repo, and one sentence.** nixlock is a session locker whose outputs do not all play the
same role: designated **kiosk** outputs stay a live, CPU-rendered display (a dashboard, or the
shipped clock) with no password affordance, while every other **Session** output is a PAM lock
screen. The security is `ext-session-lock`'s (the compositor enforces the lock); nixlock's job is to
split outputs by role without ever weakening that lock. Almost every entry below is a way of saying
one thing: *a kiosk display, a dashboard failure, a locker crash, or a swaylock-shaped CLI must never
be a way past the lock.*

Ids are machine-read (`### <ID> — <title>`, id is the first token) and stable. Do not renumber.

## Locking — the compositor holds the guarantee, not us
### LOCK-1 — no `ext-session-lock` ⇒ fail loud, never a half-locked desktop
**GIVEN** a compositor that does not advertise `ext_session_lock_manager_v1`, **THEN** nixlock exits
non-zero before painting anything, names the missing protocol, and does NOT fall back to a
layer-shell / top-layer surface that merely looks like a lock.

Why: a "lock" that is just a fullscreen window is bypassable -- another surface can take focus, the
compositor can be told to close it, a crash reveals the desktop. `ext-session-lock` is the only thing
that makes the lock a compositor-*enforced* state. The most dangerous outcome is the plausible one: a
best-effort overlay that is pixel-identical to a real lock and is not one. Refusing is the safe answer.

Not: nixlock never implements its own locking via keyboard-grab + a top layer as a "better than
nothing" fallback. Nothing-that-says-so beats something-that-lies.

### LOCK-2 — the locker dying leaves the session LOCKED
**GIVEN** nixlock crashes, is killed, or its render loop panics while the session is locked, **THEN**
the compositor keeps every output locked (ext-session-lock's defined behaviour when the lock client
dies without a clean unlock) and the session is not revealed.

Why: the guarantee must not depend on the locker staying alive. The protocol hands the compositor the
fail-secure role precisely so a bug in the locker cannot open the screen -- a locker is the one
program whose *crash* must be safe. This is only true if nixlock never takes an action that would let
its own death unlock the screen.

Not: nixlock sends the compositor's unlock request on exactly one path -- a verified password
(`SESSION-1`) -- and on no other: not a signal, not a timeout, not exit, not a panic handler.

## Kiosk — a live display that is never an escape
### KIOSK-1 — kiosk surfaces are input-inert; keys never reach the session
**GIVEN** a kiosk output rendering a live dashboard, **THEN** keyboard and pointer input over that
output is consumed by the lock and delivered to neither the dashboard content nor any session client,
and a kiosk output presents no password field and no text entry at all.

Why: the kiosk role is a *display*, not a window. Its whole reason to exist is a live screen with no
auth affordance -- so if input reached the content it would be an interactive program running on a
locked machine, which is exactly the escape the lock exists to prevent. A dashboard on a locked box
must be look-only.

Not: the kiosk never receives input to "interact with the dashboard." It renders; it does not listen.

### KIOSK-2 — kiosk content failure ⇒ that output falls back to the lock screen
**GIVEN** a kiosk output's content panics, produces no frame, or (the out-of-process path -- see
`DISPLAY-1`) its streaming client sends nothing usable, **THEN** that output reverts to a known-safe
fallback (nixlock's own clock, or -- the deeper safety net, a paint result whose byte count still
disagrees with the surface after that -- the Session lock screen), the other outputs are unaffected,
and the session stays locked.

Why: a kiosk that fails must degrade toward MORE security (a lock screen), never toward less -- never a
blank output that could read as "monitor off," never a frozen last frame, never a torn buffer. The
failure of an optional dashboard can weaken nothing.

Not: a failed kiosk never unlocks, never reveals the desktop underneath, and never takes the rest of
the lock down with it.

## Kiosk display socket — content-blind, and never a second way in
### DISPLAY-1 — a kiosk output shows the latest streamed frame, or the default clock
**GIVEN** a `Kiosk` output, **THEN** it displays the most recently accepted frame from the kiosk
display socket if one exists and its geometry matches the output exactly, and otherwise -- no
client has ever connected, no frame has arrived yet, the geometry does not match, or the client has
disconnected -- shows nixlock's own built-in clock. Never a blank output, a frozen last frame past a
disconnect, or a torn/partial buffer.

Why: this generalizes `KIOSK-2` to a client that lives in a whole separate process nixlock does not
control at all. A dashboard process can crash, hang, or simply not have started yet; the kiosk
output's failure mode must still be "falls back to something known-safe," exactly as an in-process
content failure already had to.

Not: nixlock does not retain or replay the last frame from a client that is no longer connected --
a disconnect clears back to the clock immediately, not on some later timeout.

### DISPLAY-2 — the socket is display-only; it can never unlock or accept input
**GIVEN** any byte nixlock reads off the kiosk display socket, **THEN** it is used for exactly one
purpose -- validated, then blitted as pixels to the `Kiosk` output -- and never reaches the
password buffer, the auth state machine, or the compositor's unlock call. `SESSION-1` remains the
only gate, entirely unaware the socket exists.

Why: a second channel that can influence unlock, even indirectly, would BE the lock's weak point --
so the socket protocol is deliberately one-directional and content-blind: nixlock parses only a
width/height header to size and validate a frame, never interprets the pixels themselves.

Not: nixlock never executes, evaluates, or forwards anything a kiosk client sends. A reverse channel
(input events flowing client-ward, so a streamed dashboard could itself be interactive) is a
plausible future addition and is deliberately NOT built here -- it would need its own accounting
against `KIOSK-1` before it could exist at all.

## Authentication — the credential and the conversation
### AUTH-1 — the password lives only in a zeroizing buffer
**GIVEN** a user typing a password, **THEN** the bytes land in a buffer that is zeroized on drop, are
never written to a log, file, or status, never appear in an error message, and do not survive a failed
attempt.

Why: a lock screen holds the plaintext credential every few seconds, and the one place it must never
leak is the one it is most tempted to -- a debug line, an `auth failed for "<input>"` message, a
retained "last try." The zeroizing buffer is the whole defence; an error string that interpolates the
attempt defeats it silently.

Not: nixlock keeps no password history and holds no cleartext beyond the single in-flight attempt.

### AUTH-2 — PAM runs off the render loop; the display never stalls during auth
**GIVEN** a submitted password while a kiosk dashboard (or the default clock) is animating, **THEN**
the PAM conversation runs without blocking the frame loop: the clock keeps ticking and the dashboard
keeps updating while authentication is in flight.

Why: `pam_authenticate` can block for seconds -- a slow `unix_chkpwd`, a deliberate fail delay -- and a
lock screen that freezes every visible output on each attempt looks *crashed*, which trains users to
hold the power button to get past it. A kiosk display that stutters on every keypress also stops being
the live panel it was put there to be.

Not: nixlock does not spawn an unbounded worker per keystroke; at most one auth attempt is in flight,
and the render loop owns the frame clock regardless of what auth is doing.

### AUTH-3 — an unknown or missing PAM service fails closed, and names itself
**GIVEN** a `pam_service` that names no configured PAM service on the host, **THEN** nixlock treats
every authentication as a failure -- never a success, never a fallback to `login`/`other` -- and its
diagnostic names the missing service.

Why: a lock that cannot find its own auth policy must DENY, not admit. Silently falling back to another
service authenticates against a policy nobody chose for the lock, and "it let me in because its config
was missing" is the worst possible failure for a lock screen.

Not: nixlock never guesses a service name and never substitutes a default PAM stack for the one it was
told to use.

## Session — the one gate
### SESSION-1 — only a correct PAM password unlocks; a wrong one stays locked
**GIVEN** a password submitted on a Session output, **THEN** the session unlocks if and only if PAM
returns success; a wrong password leaves the session locked, advances a visible failed-attempt
indicator, and re-arms for the next attempt.

Why: this is the single gate, and the compositor unlock request is emitted on exactly one condition --
PAM success -- and nothing adjacent to it: not a keypress count, not an elapsed time, not a received
signal. Every other input path has to be provably incapable of unlocking.

Not: no lockout that bricks the session -- a wrong password is always retryable -- and `SIGUSR1`
re-shows the indicator (`COMPAT-1`) without touching auth state. Its handler stores one flag and
returns; asserted against the handler's own source, so giving it auth state fails the build.

## Compatibility — the contract swayidle already speaks
### COMPAT-1 — swaylock-CLI compatible; `-f` daemonizes AFTER the lock is held; stays named `nixlock`
**GIVEN** swayidle invoking `nixlock -f`, **THEN** the process stays named `nixlock` (so
`pkill -USR1 nixlock` reaches it), and `SIGUSR1` is HANDLED: never fatal, and it repaints -- re-showing
the password indicator -- within one repaint tick (<=1s), touching no auth state.

**NOT YET TRUE, stated here rather than implied:** `-f` is accepted and does NOT fork; nixlock stays
in the foreground. The intent above -- acquire the lock FIRST, then daemonize, so nothing is ordered
ahead of an un-held lock -- is the target, not the behaviour. swayidle spawns commands detached, so
idle-timeout locking works today; the `before-sleep` guarantee is what is missing.

Why SIGUSR1 is called out as a guarantee and not a nicety: its default disposition is TERMINATE, and
the fleet's swayidle line ends `unlock 'pkill -USR1 nixlock'`. With no handler installed that signal
killed the locker, and by `LOCK-2` the compositor then holds every output locked with no client left
to take a password -- the "lockout that bricks the session" `SESSION-1` forbids, reachable by the one
signal the desk is actually wired to send.
Per-host values it cannot receive on that command line -- kiosk outputs, kiosk command, PAM service --
come from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nixlock/config.json`, because swayidle only ever appends `-f`.

Why: the fleet's idle daemon treats the locker as a black box it calls `<cmd> -f` and signals by
process name. Being a faithful drop-in for that contract is what lets nixlock replace swaylock with
zero swayidle changes -- and the ordering (`-f` daemonizes only after the lock is held) is the part
that matters for security, since a daemonize-then-lock locker leaves a window where the session is
already "locked" in the idle daemon's eyes but the screen is not yet covered.

Not: nixlock is not a new idle protocol or a new signalling scheme; it conforms to the existing one,
and the binary's name is part of the contract, not a cosmetic detail.

## Non-goals
- **Not a compositor.** The lock is the compositor's, via `ext-session-lock`; nixlock is the client
  (`LOCK-1`).
- **Not an idle daemon.** swayidle/hypridle own idle timeouts, suspend, and before-sleep locking;
  nixlock is only ever invoked by them.
- **Not a bar or status surface** for the unlocked desktop. The kiosk role is a display *while
  locked*.
- **Not an output/display-layout manager.** nixlock reads connector names; it does not arrange, scale,
  or toggle outputs.
- **Not multi-factor.** A screen lock here is a deliberate low-friction single-factor gate.
