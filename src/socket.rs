//! The kiosk display SOCKET SERVER: a content-BLIND Unix-domain frame receiver. Exactly one
//! external client at a time (`nixwatch-frames`, or anything speaking the same wire protocol)
//! streams premultiplied RGBA frames in; the render path (`locker.rs`) blits the latest one onto
//! the KIOSK output and falls back to nixlock's own built-in clock whenever no frame has ever
//! arrived, the frame's geometry does not match the kiosk output, or the client has disconnected.
//!
//! WIRE PROTOCOL v1 (all integers little-endian):
//!   - on connect, this server immediately writes a HELLO: 8-byte magic `b"NIXLOCK1"`, then
//!     `width: u32`, `height: u32`, `scale: u32` -- the kiosk output's current geometry. `0,0,0`
//!     means "no kiosk output" (either none is configured on this host, or the compositor has not
//!     sent its first surface `configure` yet -- see `SocketState::geometry`'s own doc).
//!   - the client then sends repeated FRAMES: `width: u32`, `height: u32`, then exactly
//!     `width*height*4` bytes of premultiplied RGBA (row-major, top-down, stride = width*4).
//!   - a frame whose geometry does not match the kiosk output is dropped (never blitted) and the
//!     connection is kept; a genuinely truncated read (the stream itself ended mid-frame) is
//!     treated the same as a clean disconnect, since there is no way to resynchronize a byte
//!     stream without knowing how much of it to discard.
//!
//! DISPLAY-ONLY, PERMANENTLY (BEHAVIORS.md DISPLAY-2): this module only ever turns received bytes
//! into pixels for one output. It has no path to `Locker`'s password buffer, auth state, or the
//! session-lock unlock call -- SESSION-1 stays the only gate, entirely untouched by anything here.
//! A reverse channel (input events client-ward, so a streamed dashboard could itself be
//! interactive) is a plausible future addition -- deliberately NOT built here; it would need its
//! own careful accounting against KIOSK-1 (kiosk surfaces are input-inert) before it could exist
//! at all.
