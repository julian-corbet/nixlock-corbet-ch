//! The content interface nixlock paints INTERNALLY: the `Session` (password) lock screen, always,

//! arrives over the Unix socket as raw premultiplied RGBA, content-blind to nixlock. A library
//! consumer's only remaining lever here is overriding the `Session` look via [`crate::builder`];
//! the shipped [`crate::ClockLockScreen`] is the default for both `Session` and the `Kiosk`
//! fallback.
